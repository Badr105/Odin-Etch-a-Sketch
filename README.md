# Odin-Etch-a-Sketch
In this project, I'll be creating a webpage to practice my DOM manipulation skills. It's going to be a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A- Sketch.
This project will be built with the tools that I have learned in the Odin Project so far, mainly Flexbox and DOM manipulation.
